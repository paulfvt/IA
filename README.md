# Find Your MBTI: Not by How You Think, but by Who You Are

Our project proposes an innovative approach to personality prediction by using demographic and behavioral data instead of traditional questionnaire-based methods. The goal is to develop an AI model that can estimate a userâ€™s MBTI personality type based on information such as nationality, gender, family situation, education level, daily habits, values, and lifestyle preferences. Using machine learning techniques, the system will identify subtle correlations between real-world attributes and psychological tendencies. A dataset combining open demographic data and self-reported MBTI types will be used to train and evaluate the model. Algorithms such as Random Forest, and Neural Networks will be explored. Unlike existing personality quizzes, this AI aims to show how data-driven insights can reveal personality traits from non-psychometric features, offering a more objective and adaptive approach to personality modeling.
